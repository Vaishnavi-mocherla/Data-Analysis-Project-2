# Comprehensive Data Analysis Project

This project encompasses a detailed exploration of various domains, employing statistical methods, machine learning techniques, and regression analysis. The project is divided into three distinct parts, each focusing on a specific dataset and analysis approach.

## Part 1: Health Dataset Analysis and Coronary Heart Disease Prediction

### Introduction

This phase involves a comprehensive analysis of a health-related dataset, aiming to understand the factors influencing coronary heart disease. The dataset consists of ten variables, representing different aspects of patients' health and lifestyle.

### Project Stages

1. **Data Classification:**
   - Categorize dataset columns into nominal, categorical, and continuous variables.

2. **Data Insights:**
   - Identify patterns, trends, or anomalies in the data to gain valuable information about factors influencing patients' health.

3. **Handling Missing Values:**
   - Identify and employ techniques to handle null values in each column.

4. **Age Analysis:**
   - Explore the age variable, including finding the oldest and youngest individuals, determining average and median age groups, and understanding the relationship between age and deaths.

5. **Data Visualization:**
   - Utilize techniques such as plotCorrelationMatrix, plotScatterMatrix, and plotPerColumnDistribution to visually represent data distributions.

6. **Logistic Regression Model:**
   - Develop a logistic regression model for classification, training it using the dataset to predict the likelihood of coronary heart disease.

### Project Goal

The primary goal is to understand the factors influencing coronary heart disease and develop a predictive model that could aid in early detection.

## Part 2: Real Estate Data Analysis and Predictive Modeling

### Introduction

This phase involves an in-depth analysis of a real estate dataset, providing insights into property prices. The dataset is comprehensive, containing both numerical and categorical features.

### Project Structure

1. **Data Exploration:**
   - Load and explore the dataset to understand its structure and composition.
   - Identify and categorize variables present in the dataset.

2. **Summary Statistics and Distribution Analysis:**
   - Calculate summary statistics for numerical columns.
   - Analyze the distribution of the "price" feature using a histogram.

3. **Hypothesis Testing:**
   - Conduct t-test and ANOVA to examine the impact of the year a property was built on its sale price.

4. **Covariance Matrix and Heatmap:**
   - Compute the covariance matrix for numerical features and create a heatmap for visual representation.

5. **Advanced Mathematical Concepts:**
   - Compute eigenvalue, eigenvector, and rank of the covariance matrix.
   - Calculate the inverse of the covariance matrix and discuss its impact on linear regression.

6. **Linear Regression Modeling:**
   - Build a linear regression model using selected features from the dataset.

### Project Conclusion

The report combines statistical analysis with machine learning techniques to provide meaningful insights into real estate data, aiming to guide decision-making in real estate investments.

## Part 3: House Price Prediction with Regression Analysis

### Introduction

This part focuses on predicting house prices using different regression methods. The dataset includes essential details such as house size, property size, number of floors, and SalePrice.

### Project Highlights

1. **Dataset Loading and Analysis:**
   - Use a data frame to load the dataset and conduct a detailed analysis, including determining the dependent variable, classifying columns, and handling outliers and missing data.

2. **Data Processing Techniques:**
   - Apply label encoding, normalization, and correlation analysis to enhance data processing.

3. **Linear Regression Models:**
   - Create and evaluate several linear regression models, including variants using stochastic gradient descent and mini-batch.

### Conclusion

The project concludes with a thorough analysis of linear regression models, highlighting the superior performance of the RANSAC model in predicting house prices accurately.
